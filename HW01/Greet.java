/* The actual action of printing out a string is essentially
the same for all of the programming languages listed - you call upon a built-in
print/display command and give it a string to output. The only difference is how the code is actually formatted and set up. For Python, indents act as seperators for functions and if statements and what not. For NetLogo, Scheme, and Java, a use of a bracket or parentheses is employed. The main difference from Java and these other languages is the fact that it is OOP, and requires a "main" function to run. No function calls are necessary - whatever is in the main function wil be run. I could write the print statement in a function outside of the main and it would do nothing - it needs to be called or used in the main function to do anything, unlike other languages where you can simply call the function anywhere.*/
